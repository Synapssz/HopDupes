# HopDupes
HopDupes is a Duplication glitch for Hypixel skyblock. We have been designing this for a while and we have now began to open this to the public!
It is in beta, if it doesnt work. Please contact me 626-310-9062 on your cell phone.

This mod only works for 1.8.9!!!
To use this mod, insert this mod in your mods folder. By doing WIN+R then typing %appdata%. Go to the .minecraft folder. Look for mods and insert the mod into the mods folder. 

If you are on feather client go to mods, 1.8.9, press add own mods, then insert the HopDupe mod into there. Then run minecraft (forge/feather client) and go to skyblock and make sure you have a hopper. Then you will press CTRL+L and then ALT F4, the CTRL+L is to work the dupe and send many packets to the console then it will lag a big. Make sure you're holding CTRL+L: as your dropping the item and then leave., it will kick you out of minecraft and when it does dont log into minecraft for an hour. Then log back in minecraft and go to skyblock and you should have your item in your hand and the item should be in the hopper. 

A person has to be on your island for this to work.


The packet sender mod is disguised as a skyblock addons mod so when or if you get screenshared by someone, it wont be a instant "omg ur hacking"
